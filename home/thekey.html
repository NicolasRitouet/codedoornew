        The first step: Apply for the scholarship and build The Key. The Key simply translates into 140h of basically non-stop coding. We got this great idea from 42. You will build, build, build. Together with your peers. You will work on projects from day one. Every candidate that has passed The Key will then be offered a full scholarship.
